/*Overview about encryption*/
Encryption is a process of converting plain text into cipher text using a secret key. There are two types of encryption algorithms: symmetric and asymmetric.

Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption. DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) are examples of symmetric encryption algorithms.

Asymmetric encryption algorithms use two different keys for encryption and decryption. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an example of an asymmetric encryption algorithm.

Develop a Window Forms application to encrypt files on the .NET Framework using the DES and AES encryption algorithms:
Program: WindowsFormApp1
Testcase encryption key for first exercise: 0F1571C947D9E859

2/
Develop an application for scanning computer ports on the .NET Framework:
Program: ConsoleApp1
Testcase Ports for choosing range:
80 (HTTP)
443 (HTTPS)
22 (SSH)
3389 (Remote Desktop Protocol)
1433 (Microsoft SQL Server)
3306 (MySQL)
5432 (PostgreSQL)

Develop a Windows application to access the database (with getting and processing data from the database):
4 methods to connect to SQLServer with Window Forms in Visual Studio:
-Normal SQL Queries
-stored Procedure to store all SQL queries
-Linq to SQL Server 
-Entities Framework
